# Job-Application-Autofill-Powered-by-ChatGPT

## Introduction
This manual guides you through the installation and usage of the Chrome extension designed to interact with OpenAI's API. This extension allows users to authenticate via Google, submit form data, receive text generated by OpenAI's models then autofill data to current webpage.

## Installation
1. **Download the Extension**: Obtain the `.zip` file containing the extension and unzip it on your local machine.
2. **Load the Extension in Chrome**:
   - Open the Chrome browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
   - Enable "Developer mode" at the top right corner.
   - Click on "Load unpacked" and select the unzipped folder of the extension.
   - The extension should now appear in your list of extensions and is ready for use.

## Configuration Instructions

After installing the Chrome extension, you need to set up the proxy server (`openai-proxy-server`) to handle requests between the extension and the OpenAI API. Follow these steps to configure your server:

#### Step 1: Create the `.env` File
1. Navigate to the `openai-proxy-server` directory within the server codebase.
2. Create a new file and name it `.env` (with no file extension).
3. Open the `.env` file in a text editor of your choice.
4. Add the following line to the file:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

   Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

5. Save and close the `.env` file. This file will be used by the server to authenticate with the OpenAI API securely.

#### Step 2: Install Necessary Dependencies
Before running the server, you need to install all the required npm packages.

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the `openai-proxy-server` directory if you are not already there.
3. Run the following command to install all dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   This command reads the `package.json` file in your server directory and installs all the necessary packages listed under `dependencies`.

#### Step 3: Start the Server
Once the `.env` file is set up and the dependencies are installed, you can start the server.

1. In the terminal, ensure you are still in the `openai-proxy-server` directory.
2. Run the server with the following command:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   or

   ```
   node server.js
   ```

   This command will start the server on the port defined in your `server.js` file (default is 3000). You should see a message indicating that the server has started, such as:

   ```
   Server started on http://localhost:3000
   ```

#### Step 4: Verify the Server is Running
To ensure that the server is set up correctly:

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you have specified).
2. You should receive a response indicating that the server is running. If you get an error, check the terminal for any error messages that can help diagnose the problem.


## Usage

##### Authenticating with Google
1. Click the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.
2. In the pop-up, click the "Log In" button to authenticate with Google.
3. Follow the prompts to sign in with your Google account.

##### Submitting Form Data
1. After signing in, fill out the form provided by the extension's template.
2. Click the "Submit" button to save the data to local storage.

##### Generating Text with OpenAI
1. The extension automatically communicates with a proxy server to send data to OpenAI.
2. Once the button 'autofill' is clicked, the server will process it and request text generation from OpenAI.
3. The generated text will be autofilled to current job application webpage.

##### Logging Out
1. To log out, click the "Log Out" button in the extension pop-up.
2. This will clear your authentication token and sign you out of the extension.

## Technical Documentation and Customization

#### Background Script (`background.js`)

The `background.js` script acts as the central hub of the Chrome extension. Its main functions include:

1. **OAuth Authentication:** Handles Google OAuth sign-in process to authenticate users securely.
2. **Message Listener:** Listens for messages from the popup and content scripts, such as requests for authentication tokens or to perform certain actions like submitting form data.
3. **Local Storage Interaction:** Handles the storage and retrieval of form data to and from Chrome's `localStorage`.
4. **Logout Functionality:** Provides a method for users to log out and clear their authentication tokens from the cache.

**Customization:**
- Users can change the `client_id` in the `background.js` to match their own Google Cloud Project's client ID if they wish to use a different storage or authentication mechanism.
- It is also possible to adjust how the script interacts with `localStorage` if needed, for instance, to store additional data or change the storage keys.

**Manifest Adjustments:**
If you change the `client_id`, remember to update the `manifest.json` file's `oauth2` section with the new client ID to maintain consistency and ensure proper functionality.

#### Server (`server.js`)

The `server.js` file is the backbone of the proxy server that communicates between the Chrome extension and the OpenAI API. It handles the following:

1. **API Request Management:** Receives requests from the extension, constructs prompts, and forwards them to OpenAI's API.
2. **Environment Configuration:** Utilizes environment variables from a `.env` file for secure API key management.
3. **Error Handling:** Captures and logs errors both from the OpenAI API and within the server itself.
4. **Response Formatting:** Structures the response from OpenAI into a format that is consumable by the client-side of the extension.

**Customization:**
- Developers can update the API endpoint (`https://api.openai.com/v1/completions`) to a different model or version if desired.
- The `constructPromptString` function can be modified to alter how prompts are constructed based on the application's needs.
- The CORS configuration can be adjusted to restrict access to specific origins for increased security in a production environment.

**Running the Server:**
Ensure that the server is running on the same port specified in the `connect-src` directive of the `manifest.json` (`localhost:3000` by default). If you change the port, you must also update the `manifest.json` file to reflect this change.

#### Manifest (`manifest.json`)

This JSON file contains metadata and settings for the Chrome extension:

1. **Permissions:** Declares the permissions needed by the extension, like access to the active tab, user identity, and local storage.
2. **Background Script:** Points to the `background.js` service worker script.
3. **Content Scripts:** Defines scripts that are injected into the web pages matched by `matches` pattern.
4. **OAuth2 Configuration:** Specifies the OAuth2 client ID and scopes required for the Google authentication.

**Customization:**
- To store data in a different Google Cloud Project, change the `client_id` in the `oauth2` field and ensure it matches the `client_id` in `background.js`.
- Adjust the `matches` pattern under `content_scripts` to control which websites the content scripts should be active on.
- Modify the `content_security_policy` if you're hosting the server elsewhere or need to add additional external scripts.

Remember, any changes made to the `client_id`, server URLs, or permissions may require additional adjustments in the corresponding JavaScript files and a new review by Google before the updated extension can be published.
